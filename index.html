<p>hi there. i am a data scientist at <a href="http://datascience.pfizer.com">pfizer data science</a> in new york. i previously worked on my ph.d. in applied and computational statistics where i was interested in statistical machine learning and non-parametric learning for high-dimensional data; i recently finished my graduate education at columbia. i was also engaged in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r-nJd-sAAAAJ&hl=en">translational genetics research</a> at weill cornell medical college to understand how changes at the level of the genome and epigenome alter the pathophysiology and treatment of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/opinion/sunday/the-feel-good-gene.html">affective disorders</a>. i am passionate about developing and applying scalable machine learning for data-driven solutions at the intersection of healthcare and tech.

<p>while not actively geeking out and having base jumped from the ivory tower, i now enjoy soccer (both <a href="http://38.media.tumblr.com/4a878b8a048a02606d0d45ad6918eb1a/tumblr_mjrvyvcs5v1s4xdz1o1_250.gif">playing</a> and watching), backpacking, playing the violin, tackling kaggle competitions with fellow <a href="https://www.henri.io">data scientists<a/> and engineers</a> around the city, and honing my <a href="http://www.randomtriviagenerator.com">random trivia skills</a> as an aspiring snapple cap fact writer.<p>
