<p>hi there. i am a data scientist at <a href="http://datascience.pfizer.com">pfizer</a>. i previously worked on my ph.d. in applied and computational statistics where i was interested in statistical learning for high-dimensional data. i was also engaged in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r-nJd-sAAAAJ&hl=en">translational genetics research</a> aimed at understanding how changes at the level of the genome and epigenome alter the pathophysiology and treatment of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/opinion/sunday/the-feel-good-gene.html">affective disorders</a>. i am passionate about developing and applying machine learning for data-driven solutions.
